= Project: bigbluebutton-api-ruby

== Goal

Provide access to the BigBlueButton web conferencing API.

== Releases

=== Version 0.0.4
Gem renamed from 'bigbluebutton' to 'bigbluebutton-api-ruby'.

First version with support also to BBB API version 0.7.

Changes:

- API functions now return a hash and instead of the XML returned by BBB. The XML is converted to a hash that uses symbols as keys and groups keys with the same name.

=== Version 0.0.3
Fixes module issue preventing proper throwing of exceptions.

=== Version 0.0.1
This is the first version of this gem. It provides an implementation of the 0.64 bbb API, with the following exceptions:

- Does not implement meeting token, and instead relies on meeting id as the unique identifier for a meeting.
- Documentation suggests there is way to call join_meeting as API call (instead of browser URL). This call currently does not work as documented.
